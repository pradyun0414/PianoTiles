 * \section sec1 Overview
\par
An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected for a common purpose. This book is an introduction to embedded systems. Specific topics include the MSPM0+ microcontroller, finite-state machines, debugging, fixed-point numbers, the design of software in assembly language and C, elementary data structures, programming input/output, interrupts, measurements with analog to digital conversion, graphics, sound production with digital to analog conversion, introduction to networks using serial communication, and real-time systems.
\par
There is a web site accompanying this book http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/mspm0. Posted here are projects for each of the example programs in the book

 * \section sec2 Hardware
\par
The hardware used in these projects include
 \li MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad (LP-MSPM0G3507)
 \li Educational BoosterPack MKII (BOOSTXL-EDUMKII)
 \li LEDs, Switches, slide pot, speaker
 \li ST7735R or SSD1306 display
<br>

These project utilize the MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad.
